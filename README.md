# PROJECT NAME

Redux Feedback Loop

## Description

This web application was created to collect user input and store it on a database. They are asked to rate their feelings and understanding about a topic, if they feel supported, and provide additional (optional) comments. At the end of the survey, users can review their answers and hit submit. After submitting, users are shown a success page and can close the window or restart and take the survey again.
